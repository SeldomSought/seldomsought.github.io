# Focus Shield

**Version:** 2.0.0
**Type:** Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)

## Install (Load Unpacked)

Focus Shield is not yet on the Chrome Web Store. Install it directly in a few steps:

1. **Download** `focus-shield.zip` from this page (or the [Releases](../../releases) tab).
2. **Unzip** the file anywhere on your computer — you'll get a folder called `focus-shield (6)`.
3. Open Chrome and go to **`chrome://extensions`**.
4. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
5. Click **"Load unpacked"**.
6. Select the unzipped `focus-shield (6)` folder.
7. The Focus Shield icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar. Done.

> **Note:** Because it's loaded unpacked, Chrome may show a "developer mode extension" warning on startup. This is normal and safe — the extension contains no tracking, no network calls, and no data collection.
